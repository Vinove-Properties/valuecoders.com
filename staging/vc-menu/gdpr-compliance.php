            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The European Union (EU) has introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to protect the fundamental right to privacy of EU residents effective from 25th May 2018. Astringent yet essential law to be enforced by the EU is made to date on how EU citizens’ and residents’ personal data is lawfully collected, processed and stored. Applicable to all organizations that process EU residents' personal data or have business arrangements with them to provide goods and services, the law gives the control back to the EU residents over the usage of their personal data.</p>
