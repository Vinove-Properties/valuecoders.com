					<h3 class="faq-accordion-toggle">What if assigned developer(s) get stuck somewhere in coding? Do you have supervisors who can assist them without requiring our help?</h3>
					<div class="faq-accordion-content" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
						<p>Yes, we have a hierarchy so that every developer, junior or senior, has a senior mentor or peers who are always there to assist. You need not worry about the hurdles until there is any dependency from your end, such as existing code access or any third-party signups. If you have hired a dedicated developer from us, we will take responsibility for providing the best performance output.</p>
